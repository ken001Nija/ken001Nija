## 🌟 Projects

Here are a few projects that showcase my skills and experiences:

1. **🏨 INN Hotels**  
   *Course: Supervised Learning - Classification*  
   Analyzed the data of INN Hotels to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations. Built a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, helping in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

2. **📱 ReCell**  
   *Course: Supervised Learning - Foundations*  
   Analyzed the used devices dataset to build a model which will help develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices. Identified factors that significantly influence the price.  
   *Skills & Tools Covered*: EDA, Linear Regression, Linear Regression assumptions, Business insights, and recommendations.

3. **📰 E-news Express Project**  
   *Course: Business Statistics*  
   Used statistical analysis, A/B testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset included important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page, which helped conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. The project also analyzed the dependence of conversion on the preferred language.  
   *Skills & Tools Covered*: Hypothesis Testing, A/B testing, Data Visualization, Statistical Inference.

4. **🍔 FoodHub Order Analysis using Python**  
   *Course: Python - Foundations*  
   The food aggregator company has stored the data of different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. The goal was to analyze the data to draw actionable insights for the business. As a Data Scientist in this company, I performed data analysis to answer key business questions that would help the company improve its operations.  
   *Skills & Tools Covered*: Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis), Python
